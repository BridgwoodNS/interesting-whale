  Hiking is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult
  walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress
  requires pushing vegetation aside.

Turtles are the only vertebrates with a [complete shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_shell).  It is formed mainly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace,
while the underside is the flatter plastron. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of [keratin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin),
the material of hair and fingernails. The carapace bones develop from ribs which grow sideways and develop broad flanges that join up to cover
the body. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally; the [sea turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_turtle) are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a
favored beach, sometimes traveling thousands of kilometers to feed before returning to the beach where they were born. It is not known how
they [navigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_navigation) though they do have a magnetic sense.

Welcome to my mock website about learning to code like a capybara... nevermind

\*\*This is a website about random animals I like! \*\*

***

Join me on this exploration into all things:

*   Capybaras

*   Foxes

*   Sheep

*   And More...

> Full disclosure - this website is really me trying out some static site generators(i.e. Jekyll)  & accompyaning CMS (Netlify-CMS).

*Thank You for reading!*

*Ryan*
